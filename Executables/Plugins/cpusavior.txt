CPU Savior Plugin for Chaoslauncher / BWLauncher (v1.6)
by R1CH

About
-----
This plugin will introduce a 1 millisecond delay every time StarCraft queries
Windows to ask what the time is (GetTickCount). Since StarCraft does this so
often with no delay, it results in 100% CPU usage. With this plugin, CPU use
is greatly reduced.

Risks
-----
Modifies Import Address Table in memory. Does not modify StarCraft code.

History
-------

v1.0 (Feb 05 2008)
  * First and final release, for 1.15.2.

v1.1 (Mar 21 2008)
  * Well I guess 1.0 wasn't the final release after all :). Added code to
    Sleep during Battle.Net dialog loop so the bnet lobby doesn't consume
    100% CPU. Hard-coded storm.dll offset, if your storm.dll is relocated
    this will likely crash.

v1.2 (Mar 27 2008)
  * Injects a thread to set the timer resolution to 1ms. This should hopefully
    fix the few cases that people reported where the plugin causes severe
    delays.

v1.3 (Apr 10 2008)
  * Fix an access violation when running on a system with DEP enabled for all
    programs.

v1.4 (Jun 02 2008)
  * Sleep only on calls from game loop, menu and bnet instead of every call.
    Hopefully this should fix the "mouse lag" reported by some users, and also
    allows replays to run at 16x without a problem. CPU usage may be slightly
    higher than previous versions however, but still nowhere near 100%.

v1.5 (Sep 14 2008)
  * Updated offsets for 1.15.3 patch.

v1.6 (Jan 10 2010)
  * Updated offsets for 1.16.1 patch. Note, 1.16.1 contains CPU Throttling
    which has a similar effect to CPU Savior, however some people report that
    CPU Throttling causes small mouse lag, likely related to no timeBeginPeriod
    call. Be sure to disable CPU Throttling if using this plugin with 1.16.1.
